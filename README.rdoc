== Rails Point of Sale

Rails Point of Sale is a simple way to make sales and track inventory. The system is based off of Active Admin and has basic features so far. I am building the software to use at Chuck's Bicycle Repair, which is a business I have opened with a friend. I will be adding features over time and eventually this will be a full featured point of sale system.
